 ## Description


Dogs gallery is amazing! Their strength and ancestral instincts make them super helpful to us. They have been used since the early 1500s for hunting. These days most house dogs don't hunt for food because they have a reliable source which is you.


The majority of dogs in our app they can be tracked by our software engineers since they are left at home the whole day as the owners have to go to work to make ends meet. This state of leaving the dog at home or in a kennel is thought by many to improve the aggressiveness of the dog. There is some truth to this. If you were to be caged up you would lose your sense of humanity and probably go crazy. They are no different from us so dogs lose their friendly aspect over time when they are caged up and their primal instincts kick in.


This is a new century newer and better methods have been discovered to make the dog more aggressive without damaging its brain. At our application, we ensure that viewers and customers receive adequate and unlimited breeds based on their physical state. We also check through all the dogs to look for any diseases that affect dogs and treat them.
